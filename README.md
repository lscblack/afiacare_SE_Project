## Project Overview: Afiacare

**Afiacare** is a healthcare management system designed to streamline and enhance patient care. The project is structured into two main folders: **client** and **server**. The **client** folder contains the frontend application, while the **server** folder holds the backend services.

### Branch Structure

- **Main Branch:** The production version of the application, tested and protected.
- **Dev Branch:** Contains updates for both the backend and frontend.
- **Frontend Branch:** Specifically for frontend updates.

### Client (Frontend)

The frontend of Afiacare is built with **React.js**. To get started, you'll need to install `pnpm`, a fast, disk space-efficient package manager:

1. **Install `pnpm`:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g pnpm
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Navigate to the client directory and run:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

### Server (Backend)

Due to security considerations, the environment variables required for the backend are not publicly provided. To set up the server on your local machine, please contact a team member:
